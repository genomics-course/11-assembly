    "In this notebook we will continue to examine the published genome assembly data for *Bd* (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30533847) that was recently assembled with PacBio reads. In the last notebook we assembled a related genome using short-read and hybrid short-read + PacBio data. Here we will assemble the genome using only PacBio long reads. In terms of the algorithms involved in assembly this will employ a quite different approach from the de Bruijn graph based approach used in the first notebook. We will try two different approaches, a very fast assembler called `miniasm`, and a much slower but more accurate method called `canu`. The latter is the method that the authors used in the study. Both are considered OLC assemblers (overlap-layout-consensus) which infers a Hamiltonian graph by mapping all reads against each other."

Then we input this overlap information along with the raw data to `miniasm` which will infer a graph assembly -- the best way to uniquely connect all overlapping sequences. This involves splitting ambiguous loops in the graph and calculating the shortest path through the graph. The result can be converted to a final fasta file representing the consensus assembled contigs. \n",

Although this step runs pretty fast it is too memory-intensive (requires many Gb of RAM) to run on the small servers that we have available on binder or codio. We will instead continue to examine pre-prepared result files. "

(Note: there are many other tools available as well, some of which can potentially be both fast and accurate).\n",
